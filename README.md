## Peer-graded Assignment: Prediction Assignment Writeup

These pages contain the writeup of the analysis of weight-lifting data. The exercise was designed to be able to predict the type of 
lifting performed (type A, B, D, D, or E) as predicted by a row of data. A machine learning algorithm was to be chosen so as to most 
accurately carry out this prediction. 

Of the two types of ML model investigated (decision tree or random forests) random forests was chosen as the most likely to give a correct
prodiction.
